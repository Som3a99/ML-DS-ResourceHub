    "3. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.\n",
    "4. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.\n",
    "5. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",
    "6. Python is a general-purpose programming language, so it can be used for many things. Python is used for web development, AI, machine learning, operating systems, mobile application development, and video games.\n",
    "7. Python is a scripting language, which means that it is primarily used to write scripts to automate tasks rather than to write code for applications.\n",
    "8. Python is a high-level language, which means that it is closer to human language than machine language. This makes it easier to read and understand than low-level languages.\n",
    "9. Python is an interpreted language, which means that it is not converted to machine code before it is run. This makes it easier to test and debug because you can see what the code is doing while it is running.\n",
    "10. Python is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to model real-world objects."
